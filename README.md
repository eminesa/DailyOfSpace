**Coroutine-Flow:** 
Coroutines and Flow are used for asynchronous operations, allowing for smooth and non-blocking execution of tasks. They are essential for handling background processes and managing concurrency in the app.

**Hilt:** 
Hilt is employed for dependency injection, simplifying the management of dependencies and promoting code modularity. It enhances code readability and maintainability.

**Navigation Component:** 
Navigation Component is used to handle navigation between different screens and components within the app. It streamlines navigation logic and simplifies the user experience.

**Retrofit 2 / Okhttp3:** 
Retrofit 2 and Okhttp3 are utilized for efficient network communication, making API requests and responses seamless. They ensure reliable and performant data exchange between the app and the server.

**Coil:** 
Coil is the go-to library for image loading, optimizing the loading and caching of images, and enhancing the app's overall performance.

**Lottie:**
